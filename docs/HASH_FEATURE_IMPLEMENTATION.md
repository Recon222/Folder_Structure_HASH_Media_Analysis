# Hash Feature Implementation Documentation

## Overview

The Hash Feature provides comprehensive file hashing and verification capabilities for the Folder Structure Utility. This feature adds a dedicated "Hashing" tab that supports both single hash generation and dual-source hash verification operations, complementing the existing forensic workflows.

---

## Feature Components

### Core Architecture

The hash feature follows the established application architecture patterns:

```
ui/tabs/hashing_tab.py          # Main UI interface
controllers/hash_controller.py   # Coordination layer  
core/hash_operations.py         # Business logic
core/workers/hash_worker.py     # Async processing threads
core/hash_reports.py            # CSV report generation
core/settings_manager.py        # Extended for hash algorithm selection
```

### Supported Algorithms

- **SHA-256** (default, forensic-grade)
- **MD5** (legacy compatibility)

Algorithm selection is persistent via QSettings and integrates with existing forensic hash calculations.

## User Interface

### Tab Layout

**Layout Structure: Console-First (Option 2)**
- **Top Section (40% height)**: Operations side-by-side
  - Single Hash Operation (left)
  - Hash Verification (right)
- **Bottom Section (60% height)**: Large console for detailed progress output
- **Algorithm Selection**: Persistent dropdown at top

### Single Hash Operation

**Purpose**: Calculate hashes for files and folders with recursive processing.

**Components**:
- File/folder selection panel (FilesPanel component reuse)
- "Calculate Hashes" button
- "Export CSV" button (enabled after completion)

**Workflow**:
1. User selects files/folders via drag-drop or browse
2. System recursively discovers all files in folders
3. Progress shown file-by-file in console
4. Results can be exported to CSV with metadata

### Hash Verification

**Purpose**: Compare hashes between two sets of files/folders to detect differences.

**Components**:
- Source Files/Folders panel
- Target Files/Folders panel  
- "Verify Hashes" button
- "Export CSV" button (enabled after completion)

**Workflow**:
1. User selects source and target files/folders
2. System hashes both sets independently
3. Files matched by name and compared
4. Detailed match/mismatch results shown in console
5. Comprehensive verification report exportable to CSV

## Technical Implementation

### Business Logic Layer

**HashOperations Class** (`core/hash_operations.py`)

Key capabilities:
- Streaming hash calculation with progress callbacks
- Recursive file discovery preserving folder structures
- Memory-efficient processing (constant ~32KB usage)
- Robust error handling and cancellation support

```python
# Core data structures
@dataclass
class HashResult:
    file_path: Path
    relative_path: Path
    algorithm: str
    hash_value: str
    file_size: int
    duration: float
    error: Optional[str] = None

@dataclass  
class VerificationResult:
    source_result: HashResult
    target_result: Optional[HashResult]
    match: bool
    comparison_type: str
    notes: str
```

**Hash Algorithm Support**:
- SHA-256: `hashlib.sha256()`
- MD5: `hashlib.md5()`
- 64KB streaming buffer for optimal performance
- Automatic cancellation support

### Worker Threads

**SingleHashWorker** (`core/workers/hash_worker.py`)
- Processes files/folders for hash generation
- Emits progress, status, and completion signals
- Returns structured results with performance metrics

**VerificationWorker** (`core/workers/hash_worker.py`)
- Handles dual-source hash comparison
- Orchestrates source and target hashing operations
- Performs intelligent file matching and comparison

**Signal Pattern**:
```python
# Standard worker signals
progress = Signal(int)  # Progress percentage
status = Signal(str)   # Status message  
finished = Signal(bool, str, object)  # success, message, results
```

### Controller Layer

**HashController** (`controllers/hash_controller.py`)

Responsibilities:
- Validates inputs and algorithm selection
- Manages worker thread lifecycle
- Provides operation cancellation
- Integrates with settings for algorithm persistence

Key methods:
- `start_single_hash_operation()`
- `start_verification_operation()`  
- `cancel_current_operation()`
- `is_operation_running()`

### Report Generation

**HashReportGenerator** (`core/hash_reports.py`)

**Single Hash CSV Format**:
```csv
File Path, Relative Path, File Size (bytes), Hash (SHA-256), Processing Time (s), Speed (MB/s), Status, Error Message
```

**Verification CSV Format**:
```csv
Source File Path, Target File Path, Source Relative Path, Target Relative Path, Source File Size (bytes), Target File Size (bytes), Source Hash (SHA-256), Target Hash (SHA-256), Verification Status, Match Type, Notes
```

**Forensic-Compatible Format**: 
Generates CSV compatible with existing forensic hash verification format for workflow integration.

**Features**:
- UTF-8 encoding for international filenames
- Metadata headers with generation timestamp and statistics
- Proper CSV escaping for paths with special characters
- Default filename generation with timestamp

---

## Settings Integration

### Extended SettingsManager

**New Settings**:
- `hash_algorithm`: SHA-256 or MD5 selection with validation
- Persistent across application sessions
- Setter with validation: `settings.hash_algorithm = 'md5'`

**Integration Points**:
- Algorithm dropdown syncs with settings on load
- Changes immediately persisted via QSettings
- Compatible with existing forensic hash settings

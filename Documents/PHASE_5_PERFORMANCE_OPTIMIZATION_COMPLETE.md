## 💡 Implementation Highlights

### Smart Copy Strategy
```python
if file_size < SMALL_FILE_THRESHOLD:  # <1MB
    # Direct copy - fastest for small files
    shutil.copy2(source, dest)
else:
    # Stream copy with buffer
    self._stream_copy(source, dest, buffer_size, file_size)
```

### Real-time Metrics Collection
```python
# Emit metrics every 100ms for smooth UI updates
self.metrics_updated.emit(metrics)
# Update speed samples for graphs
metrics.add_speed_sample(current_speed_mbps)
```

### Feature Flag Integration
```python
if settings.use_buffered_operations:
    file_ops = BufferedFileOperations(...)  # New system
else:
    file_ops = FileOperations(...)  # Legacy fallback
```

---

## 🔧 Configuration

## ⚠️ Known Issues & Limitations

### Performance Monitor Issues:

Based on the performance report showing problematic metrics:
- **Files show 0/0** despite 228 files being processed (88 small + 109 medium + 31 large)
- **Duration shows 0.0 seconds** which is impossible for 25.9GB of data
- **Average Speed 0.0 MB/s** due to duration calculation error
- **Peak Speed 969.8 MB/s** seems unrealistic (likely a spike from small file)

### Specific Problems Identified:

1. **File Count Not Updating**
   - `files_processed` counter not incrementing properly
   - Total files shows 0 instead of actual count
   - Issue in: `BufferedFileOperations.copy_files()` method

2. **Performance Monitor Hanging**
   - Monitor gets stuck on large files
   - Doesn't resume after large file completes
   - Continues running during ZIP creation without showing ZIP progress
   - ZIP operation blocked until monitor manually stopped

3. **Metrics Collection Issues**
   - Duration calculation failing (end_time - start_time = 0)
   - File counter not syncing with actual operations
   - Progress not properly aggregated across multiple files

4. **Thread Synchronization Problems**
   - MetricsCollector thread not properly stopping
   - Blocking ZIP operations from completing
   - Missing proper cleanup on operation completion

### Root Causes:

1. **Metrics Not Aggregating**: Each file copy creates new metrics instead of updating shared metrics
2. **Thread Lifecycle**: MetricsCollector thread not properly managed between operations
3. **Counter Logic**: `files_processed` increments but gets reset or not properly tracked
4. **Time Tracking**: Start/end times not properly set for overall operation

### Required Fixes (Not Yet Implemented):

1. Fix file counting in `BufferedFileOperations`
2. Proper metrics aggregation across all files
3. Fix MetricsCollector thread lifecycle management
4. Ensure monitor stops automatically when operations complete
5. Add proper duration tracking for overall operation
6. Prevent monitor from blocking ZIP operations

---

## 📋 Actual Performance Results

Despite monitoring issues, the system IS using buffered operations as evidenced by:
- Log shows: "[HIGH-PERFORMANCE MODE] Using buffered file operations"
- 25.9GB of data was successfully transferred
- File distribution properly categorized (88 small, 109 medium, 31 large)
- Operations complete successfully

The performance improvements are working, but the monitoring/reporting layer has issues.

---

## 🚨 Critical TODO for Phase 5.1

1. Fix metrics aggregation and file counting
2. Resolve thread synchronization issues
3. Fix duration and speed calculations
4. Ensure monitor auto-stops on completion
5. Add proper ZIP operation monitoring
6. Comprehensive testing of monitor with various file sizes

*Phase 5 completed with functional performance improvements but monitoring system requires additional fixes.*
